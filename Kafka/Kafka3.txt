key serializer:

key.serializer
Kafka brokers expect byte arrays as keys and values of messages
org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serializer interface
ByteArraySerializer (which doesn’t do much),
StringSerializer, and IntegerSerializer.
Setting key.serializer is
required even if you intend to send only values

value.serializer
-||- as key

bootstrap.servers
List of host:port pairs of brokers that the producer will use to establish initial
connection to the Kafka cluster. This list doesn’t need to include all brokers, since
the producer will get more information after the initial connection. But it is recommended
to include at least two, so in case one broker goes down, the producer
will still be able to connect to the cluster.

KafkaProducer has two types of errors. Retriable errors are those that can be resolved
by sending the message again.
