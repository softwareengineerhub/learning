A Zookeeper cluster is called an ensemble
Due to the algorithm used, it is recommended
that ensembles contain an odd number of servers (e.g., 3, 5, etc.) as a majority
of ensemble members (a quorum) must be working in order for Zookeeper to
respond to requests.


To configure Zookeeper servers in an ensemble, they must have a common configuration
that lists all servers, and each server needs a myid file in the data directory that
specifies the ID number of the server. If the hostnames of the servers in the ensemble
are zoo1.example.com, zoo2.example.com, and zoo3.example.com, the configuration
file might look like this:
tickTime=2000
dataDir=/var/lib/zookeeper
clientPort=2181
initLimit=20
syncLimit=5
server.1=zoo1.example.com:2888:3888
server.2=zoo2.example.com:2888:3888
server.3=zoo3.example.com:2888:3888


In this configuration, the initLimit is the amount of time to allow followers to connect
with a leader. The syncLimit value limits how out-of-sync followers can be with
the leader. Both values are a number of tickTime units, which makes the initLimit
20 * 2000 ms, or 40 seconds. The configuration also lists each server in the ensemble.
The servers are specified in the format server.X=hostname:peerPort:leaderPort, with
the following parameters:
X
The ID number of the server. This must be an integer, but it does not need to be
zero-based or sequential.
hostname
The hostname or IP address of the server.
peerPort
The TCP port over which servers in the ensemble communicate with each other.
leaderPort
The TCP port over which leader election is performed.
