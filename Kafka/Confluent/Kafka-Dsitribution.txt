Distribution
The partitions of the log are distributed over the servers in the Kafka cluster
 with each server handling data and requests for a share of the partitions. 
Each partition is replicated across a configurable number of servers for fault tolerance.

Each partition has one server that acts as the “leader” and zero or more servers which act as “followers”. 
The leader handles all read and write requests for the partition
 while the followers passively replicate the leader. 
If the leader fails, one of the followers will automatically become the new leader. 
Each server acts as a leader for some of its partitions and a follower for others so 
that load is successfully balanced within the cluster.
