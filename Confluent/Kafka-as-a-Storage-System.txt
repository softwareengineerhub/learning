Kafka as a Storage System
Any message queue that publishes messages decoupled from consumption of
 them is acting as a storage system for the in-flight messages.
 Kafka is a very good storage system.
Data written to Kafka is written to disk and replicated for fault-tolerance.
 Kafka allows producers to wait on acknowledgement. A write isnâ€™t 
considered complete until it is fully replicated and guaranteed to persist even if the server written to fails.
The disk structures Kafka uses are able to scale well. 
Kafka performs the same whether you have 50 KB or 50 TB of persistent data on the server.
