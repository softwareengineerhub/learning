1) Backward
write with old schema read with new schema

2) Forward
write with new schema read with old

Two patterns:
1) Write a forward compatible change (very common)
 - update your producer to V2, you won't break your consumers
 - take your time to update your consumers to V2

2) Write a backward compatible change (less common)
- update all consumers to V2, you still be able to read V1 producer data
- when all are updated, update producer to V2
