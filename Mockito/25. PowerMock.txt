Early Mockito --> no mocks for final or static methods, and for constructors

Solution --> PowerMock

Latest Mockito (since 3.5):
- mocks for final methods
- mocks for static methods
- mocking object construction

Junit5 - since 2017
But in 2020 PowerMock - does not support in natively

It's better to focus only on mockito.
