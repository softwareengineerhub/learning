Query-first design
By contrast, in Cassandra you don’t start with the data model; you start with the
query model. Instead of modeling the data first and then writing queries, with Cassandra
you model the queries and let the data be organized around them. Think of
the most common query paths your application will use, and then create the tables
that you need to support them


Designing for optimal storage
A key goal as you begin creating data models in Cassandra is to minimize the number
of partitions that must be searched in order to satisfy a given query. Because the partition
is a unit of storage that does not get divided across nodes, a query that searches a
single partition will typically yield the best performance


Sorting is a design decision
In Cassandra, however, sorting is treated differently; it is a design decision. The sort
order available on queries is fixed, and is determined entirely by the selection of clustering
columns you supply in the CREATE TABLE command. The CQL SELECT statement
does support ORDER BY semantics, but only in the order specified by the
clustering columns (ascending or descending)

Logical Data Modeling

To name each table, identify the primary entity type for which you are querying, and
use that to start the entity name. If you are querying by attributes of other related
entities, you append those to the table name, separated with _by_. For example,
hotels_by_poi.

Next, identify the primary key for the table, adding partition key columns based on
the required query attributes, and clustering columns in order to guarantee uniqueness
and support desired sort ordering


The design of the primary key is extremely important, as it will
determine how much data will be stored in each partition and how
that data is organized on disk, which in turn will affect how quickly
Cassandra processes read queries

Physical Data Modeling
Once you have a logical data model defined, creating the physical model is a relatively
simple process.
You walk through each of your logical model tables, assigning types to each item. You
can use any of the types you learned in Chapter 4, including the basic types, collections,
and user-defined types. You may identify additional user-defined types that can
be created to simplify your design.
After you’ve assigned data types, yo

Calculating Partition Size
In order to calculate the size of your partitions, you use the following formula:
Nr = 100 rooms/hotel × 730 days = 73, 000 rows
