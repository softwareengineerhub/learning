data
This directory is where Cassandra stores its data. By default, there are subdirectories
under the data directory, corresponding to the various datafiles Cassandra
uses: commitlog, data, hints, and saved_caches. We’ll explore the
significance of each of these datafiles in Chapter 6. If you’ve been trying different
versions of the database and aren’t worried about losing data, you can delete
these directories and restart the server as a last resort.

logs
This directory is where Cassandra stores its logs in a file called system.log. If you
encounter any difficulties, consult the log to see what might have happened.


The datafile locations are configurable in the cassandra.yaml file,
located in the conf directory. The properties are called
data_file_directories, commit_log_directory, hints_direc
tory, and saved_caches_directory



run the command cassandra -f to start your server.
Using the -f switch tells Cassandra to stay in the foreground
instead of running as a background process, so that all of the server
logs will print to standard out (stdout in Unix systems) and you
can see them in your terminal window, which is useful for testing.
In either case, the logs will append to the system.log file.

./start-server
./stop-server

or
start-server.bat
stop-server.bat

to stop Casssandra you need to kill jvm


CQLSH
to start:

./cqlsh
./cqlsh localhost 9042
or 
cqlsh.bat 
(python is required)


cqlsh> help;
cqlsh> DESCRIBE CLUSTER;
cqlsh> DESCRIBE KEYSPACES;
cqlsh> SHOW VERSION;
cqlsh:my_keyspace> DESCRIBE TABLE user;

SELECT * FROM user where first_name = 'Bill';
If you want to execute this query despite the
performance unpredictability, use ALLOW FILTERING"

cqlsh:my_keyspace> TRUNCATE user;
cqlsh:my_keyspace> DROP TABLE user;



DOCKER:
$docker pull cassandra
$docker run --name my-cassandra cassandra
$docker start cassandra -p 9042:9042
cqlsh
$docker exec -it my-cassandra cqlsh
